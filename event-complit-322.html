	<div>The conventional distinction between originals and copies has posed a challenge to translation for about as long as the translation has attracted theoretical investigation. In this undergraduate seminar, we will explore how this distinction has been drawn and redrawn across centuries, and we will test the theoretical perspectives we encounter against our own translation practices. We will supplement our readings in history and theory with examples of translations that have extended, redefined, or simply replaced their originals.</div>
